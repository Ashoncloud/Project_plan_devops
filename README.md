Project description :

Insurance :
Insure-Me has decided to transform its monolithic application architecture to microservice application architecture and opted to go DevOps by implementing CICD pipeline and necessary automations. Insure me has decided to use AWS as primary cloud services provider to create servers, databases, and application deployments.
The company’s goal is to deliver the product updates frequently to production with High
quality & Reliability. They also want to accelerate software delivery speed, quality and reduce
feedback time between developers and testers.
Following are the problems the company is facing at the moment
✓ Building Complex builds is difficult
✓ Manual efforts to test various components/modules of the project
✓ Incremental builds are difficult to manage, test and deploy
✓ Creation of infrastructure and configure it manually is very time consuming
✓ Continuous manual monitoring the application is quite challenging.

Banking & finance
FinanceMe is a Global leading Banking and Financial services provider based out of Germany. The company offers products and services like Banking, Funds Management, Loans, Debit Cards and Credits Cards, Investment Banking etc. Initially the company was using a Monolithic application architecture, As the company grown, It started facing difficulties in managing the application infrastructure and application deployments and Scaling of application when the traffic load increases.

The company’s goal is to deliver the product updates frequently to production automatically with High quality & Reliability. They also want to accelerate software delivery speed, quality and reducing feedback time between developers and testers.
Currently, they are facing following problems, because of various technologies involved in the project.
✓ Building Complex Monolithic Application is difficult.
✓ Manual efforts to test various components/modules of the project
✓ Incremental builds are difficult to manage, test and deploy.
✓ It was not possible to scale up individual modules independently.
✓ Creation of infrastructure and configure it manually is very time consuming
✓ Continuous manual monitoring the application is quite challenging.

Healthcare:
Medicure is a super specialty hospital based in New York, USA and provide world class treatment and surgery including Heart, Liver, Kidney transplants and first robotic surgery center. The chain is owned and managed by Global Health Limited.
The Medicure would centrally like to manage all the doctor’s and patient’s data across the Medicure hospitals in various cities. They have developed an microservice, which offers these services. In order to reduce unnecessary maintenance cost and manual labor, they would like to automate their application build and deployment process using DevOps. They are fine to use any one of the (AWS, Azure, GCP) cloud platform as their primary cloud service provider.
The company’s primary goal is to deliver the product updates frequently to production with High quality & Reliability. They also want to accelerate software delivery speed, quality and reduce feedback time between developers and testers. They would like to use Kubernetes to manage their container deployments, scaling and descaling of containers etc.
Initially, Medicure is facing multiple problems, because of involved complexity in application as well as Infrastructure.
Following are the problems:
✓ Building Complex builds is difficult
✓ Manual efforts to test various components/modules of the project
✓ Incremental builds are difficult to manage, test and deploy
✓ Creation of infrastructure and configure it manually is very time consuming
✓ Continuous manual monitoring the application is quite challenging.
